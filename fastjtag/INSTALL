Well, not really how to install I guess, but heres what to do with all this:

Host utilities
--------------
miniload        Loads code into the PXA mini-icache and executes it.
rdevmem         Allows you to read / write memory on the PXA (use with
                memclient.bin)
rdump           Dumps a region of memory from the PXA (use with memclient.bin)
rflash          Remote reflash tool (use with memclient.bin)
fflash          Alternative to rflash (slightly simpler)

Client utilities   (load these into the PXA with miniload)
----------------
e7xx_leds.bin   Flashes the battery LED on the e7xx
h1900leds.bin   ditto
memclient.bin   Contains routines to interface with the host tools above
                allowing fast JTAG operations (avoids using boundary scan)
