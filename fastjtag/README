FastJTAG FM (Fscking Manual)

-------------------------------------------------

This project can *NOT* flash a device via the PXA boundary scan.

What you can do, is (by other means) load some code into the PXA which allows faster JTAG communication, and allowing upload of code to the PXA chip for execution.

jtagrx.bin is the stub that should be running on the PXA to receive the 'upload' into the PXA icache.

once it is running, you can upload up to 2KB of code using the miniload program on your host machine.

a program you can upload is memclient.bin, which allows you to perform various operations by 'remote control' over the JTAG lead. A program that can communicate with memclient is rdevmem, which behaves like devmem under linux (except, obviously, it is 'remote').

Enjoy.
